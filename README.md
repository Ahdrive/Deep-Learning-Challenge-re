The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks. I created a binary classifier that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The CSV contains more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 
Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively
